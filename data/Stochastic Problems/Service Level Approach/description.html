        The Service Level Constrained Problems module analyzes both the (s, Q) continuous review and
        (S, T) periodic review policies with backorder under a given service level and assuming that the
        demand per unit of time is normally distributed. The review policies are analyzed under the
        following three cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the first case, a <b>cycle service level</b> (CSL) (probability of no stockout per cycle) is specified
        to determine the reorder point and target inventory. The ordering quantity, Q, and cycle time, T,
        are based on the economic order quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the second case, a <b>fill rate</b> (FR) (fraction of the demand satisfied directly from stock) is
        specified to determine the reorder point and target inventory. The ordering quantity, Q, and cycle
        time, T, are based on the economic order quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the third case, the module minimizes the expected ordering and holding costs per unit of
        time subject to a service constraint that sets the fill rate to a specified value.
        In all the three cases, the module computes the implied shortage cost and the resulting total
        expected cost per unit of time.
