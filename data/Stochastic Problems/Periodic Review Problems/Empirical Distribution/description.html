        The <i>Periodic Review Problems module</i> analyzes the (S, T) inventory ordering policy under which
        the inventory system is reviewed every T units of time and an order is placed to raise the
        inventory position to the target inventory, S . The model considered in this module is the
        approximate treatment of the periodic review with mixture of backorder and lost sales based on
        the approximation of Hadley and Whitin (Analysis of inventory system, Prentice Hall, 1963).
        The problem is to find the optimal S and T that minimize the approximate expected total cost per
        unit of time. The modules used 5 probability distributions to describe the demand per unit of
        time. They are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Erlang</li>
        <li>Exponential</li>
        <li>Gamma</li>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Poisson</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the user can also enter his/her own empirical discrete probability distribution by
        entering the set of possible demand values per unit of time and their associated probabilities. In
        this case, the length of lead time period should be taken as the unit of time.
        The module also provides a solution to the problem under the <b>free distribution approach</b> which
        only assumes the knowledge of the first two moments of demand distribution and not necessarily
        its form.
