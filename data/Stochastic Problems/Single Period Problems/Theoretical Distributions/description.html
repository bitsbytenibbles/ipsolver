        The <i>Single Period Problems module</i> addresses the classical inventory model with uncertain
        demand and single opportunity for placing an order often referred to in the literature as “the
        single period”, ‘newsvendor’, ‘newsboy’, or ‘Christmas Tree’ problem. Such a problem arises
        when, for example, a store manager has only one opportunity to place an order for a product to
        be sold during a <b>short</b> selling period (smaller than the procurement lead time) without knowing
        for certain the demand for the product. Inventory cannot be added later in case the demand for
        the period exceeds the amount ordered. A holding cost is charged for every unit not sold and
        held at the end of the period. On the other hand, when demand exceeds the ordering quantity, the
        store incurs a shortage penalty cost. The problem is to find the optimal target inventory to set at
        the beginning of the period that maximizes the expected profit under both situations with zero an
        non-zero ordering cost. The modules used 12 probability distributions to describe the total
        demand over the selling period. They are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Continuous Uniform</li>
        <li>Discrete Uniform</li>
        <li>Erlang</li>
        <li>Exponential</li>
        <li>Gamma</li>
        <li>Laplace</li>
        <li>Lognormal</li>
        <li>Negative Binomial</li>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Poisson</li>
        <li>Triangular</li>
        <li>Weibull.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the user can also enter his/her own empirical discrete probability distribution by
        entering the set of possible demand values and their associated probabilities.
        The module also provides a solution to the problem under the <b>free distribution approach</b> which
        only assumes the knowledge of the first two moments of demand distribution and not necessarily
        its form.
