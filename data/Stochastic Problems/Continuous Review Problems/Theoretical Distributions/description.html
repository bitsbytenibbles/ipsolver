        The <i>Continuous Review Problems module</i> analyzes the (s, Q) inventory ordering policy under
        which the inventory position (on-hand + on-order â€“ backorder) is monitored continuously and an
        order of size Q is placed whenever the inventory position hits the reorder point, s. The model
        considered in this module is the approximate treatment of the continuous review with mixture of
        backorder and lost sales based on the approximation of Hadley and Whitin (Analysis of
        inventory system, Prentice Hall, 1963). The problem is to find the optimal s and Q that minimize
        the approximate expected total cost per unit of time. The modules used 12 probability
        distributions to describe the lead time demand. They are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Continuous Uniform</li>
        <li>Discrete Uniform</li>
        <li>Erlang</li>
        <li>Exponential</li>
        <li>Gamma</li>
        <li>Laplace</li>
        <li>Lognormal</li>
        <li>Negative Binomial</li>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Poisson</li>
        <li>Triangular</li>
        <li>Weibull.</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the user can also enter his/her own empirical discrete probability distribution by
        entering the set of possible lead time demand values and their associated probabilities.
        The module also provides a solution to the problem under the <b>free distribution approach</b> which
        only assumes the knowledge of the first two moments of demand distribution and not necessarily
        its form.
