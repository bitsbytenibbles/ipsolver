        The Dynamic Lot Sizing Problems module generates the quantities to be ordered over a known and fixed planning horizon for as single item with deterministic and discrete time varying demand.
        The problem solved by this module is often called the Dynamic Lot Sizing Problem (DLSP).
        The module can solve both cases when shortages are allowed or disallowed depending on the value entered for the backorder cost. Seven lot sizing procedures are implemented in this module.
        They are

    <ul>
        <li>Zangwill optimal procedure, which reduces to Wagner and Whitinâ€™s procedure when shortages are disallowed.</li>
        <li>Silver-Meal heuristic procedure.</li>
        <li>Least Unit Cost heuristic procedure.</li>
        <li>Part Period Balancing heuristic procedure.</li>
        <li>Economic Order Quantity heuristic procedure.</li>
        <li>Periodic Order Quantity heuristic procedure.</li>
        <li>Lot-for-Lot heuristic procedure.</li>
    </ul>
