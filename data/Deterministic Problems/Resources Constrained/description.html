        The Resources Constrained Problems module addresses multi-items inventory lot sizing problems with limited resources.
        This module determines the ordering quantities that minimize the total inventory system cost without exceeding the resources capacities.
        It solves several multi-item inventory models under single and two restrictions with and without shortages.
        The types of constraints that are included in this module are:			
    </p>
    <ul>
            <li>inventory investment (budget) constraint</li>
            <li>turnover ratio constraint</li>
            <li>storage capacity constraint</li>
            <li>number of orders/setups</li>
            <li>setup capacity constraint</li>
            <li>storage capacity and budget constraints</li>
            <li>storage capacity and turnover ratio constraints</li>
    </ul>
