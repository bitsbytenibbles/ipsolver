        Given a known and constant demand, the Quantity Discount Problems module determines the least cost ordering quantity and maximum backorder level in the presence of either all-unit or incremental discounts.
        The model assumes that the time independent shortage cost is negligible.
        The model can treat both cases when the holding cost remains constant or is discounted as the unit purchasing cost is discounted.
