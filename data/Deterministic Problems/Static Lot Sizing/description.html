        The Static Lot Sizing Problems module solves the general static lot sizing problem with constant demand and production rates and lead time.
        The module allows shortages to be backordered at finite time dependent and independent costs.
        Special cases such as the economic order quantity problem can also be solved by entering the appropriate data.
        The module generates the optimal production/ordering quantity and maximum backorder level that minimize the total inventory system costs per unit of time, which is composed of the production/purchasing cost, setup/ordering cost, holding cost and shortage cost.
