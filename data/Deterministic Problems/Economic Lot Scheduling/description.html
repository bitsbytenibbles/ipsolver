        The Economic Lot Scheduling Problems module enables the user to solve the classical one machine lot scheduling problem where a set of items compete for the capacity of a single machine that can process one item at a time.
        The module generates a production schedule for a set of items that are processed on a single machine by minimizing the total setup and holding costs per unit of time under the assumption of known constant demand and production rates.
        The problem can also be solved under both assumptions of finite and infinite backorder cost.
        The module employs the rotation schedule heuristic which restricts all items to share a common order interval so that each item is produced once per cycle in a given schedule.
        The module also provides a lower bound on the total cost per unit of time which is obtained by relaxing the synchronization constraint (the machine can only be used to setup or to produce one item at a time).
